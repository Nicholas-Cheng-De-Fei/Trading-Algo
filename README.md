## üìù **Description**

This projects attempts to find market arbitrage especially when the market enters into states of disorientations using the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic differential equation**. The OU price generated by the equation creates an artificial price target to exit when the stock approaches the OU price.

### **Key Highlights:**
- Statistical modeling of ETF/Currencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Mathematical Framework**

The relationship between securities' prices and its conventional market sentiment is modeled using the **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process**:

$$
dX_t = \theta (\mu - X_t) dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

Where:
- $X_t$: Current price of security.
- $\theta$: Speed of mean reversion where $\theta$ = ln(0.5)/ln(b)
- $\mu$: Long-term mean of the spread.
- $\sigma$: Volatility of the spread.
- $dW_t$: Brownian motion term.
